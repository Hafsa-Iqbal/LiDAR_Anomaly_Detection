1- Create a new folder called "dataset" and unzip all dataset files in there

2- Run "Pre_trainednetwork_Modelnet40.m" to generate a pretrained network.
   This process may take many hours, we have uploaded an already pretrained
   network called "modelnet40PretrainNetwork.mat" so you can skip this step

3- Run "FeatureExtraction.m" to get the features of the testing data using the transfer learning
